Personal data-analyst portfolio web page

Aim is to program a web page portfolio to mainly present the projects I'm working on and that are already finished. Languages will probably be HTML5 and CSS, for the aim is not to show off those languages particularly, but python, LaTex, Excel, Tableau etc.
